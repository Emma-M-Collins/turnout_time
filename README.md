# A Statistical Analysis of Thornton Fire Department Turnout Time

* Consulting with Thornton Fire Department (TFD) of Thornton, Colorado in the Denver Metro area.
* TFD wanted to improve turnout time, the time it takes a firefighting crew to put on the proper gear and leave the station after being notified of a call.
* Focus on *inference* instead of *prediction*.

The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) recommends a 60 second turnout time (blue) for EMS calls and 80 seconds (red) for complex calls.

* Raw data was provided by TFD.  Through discussion with TFD personell, hundreds of variables were narrowed down to less than 15 to be considered in the model.  
* _The Goal_: Determine which variables, such as apparatus, shift, station, and call type, result in longer turnout times.
